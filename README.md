Solarpunk is a movement and aesthetic that envisions a future where society is rooted in ecological balance, technological advancement, and communal well-being. The core tenets of this movement include:

1. **Decentralization**: Emphasizing the importance of decentralizing power and resources, Solarpunk advocates for community governance and local, self-sufficient systems​
2. **Ecological Awareness and Long-term Design**: This involves a deep understanding of ecological principles and designing for the long term, focusing on sustainability, greentech, and living in harmony with nature​
3. **Communal and Sustainable Living**: Solarpunk envisions communities that are both sustainable and technologically advanced, with walkable cities and an abundance of plant life, promoting a life that is communal and in balance with the environment
4. **Inspiration from Sustainable Architecture**: Taking practical inspiration from structures like Earthships, Solarpunk incorporates sustainable architecture and design principles to create living spaces that are interconnected with nature and community
5. **Balance of Nature and Technology**: Striving for a balance between the natural world and technological advancements, solarpunk worlds often incorporate the aesthetic of Art Nouveau, emphasizing degrowth, and decentralization
6. **Climate Justice**: There's a strong emphasis on climate justice, acknowledging and addressing the needs of those most impacted by climate change and environmental degradation
7. **Rebellion and Counterculture**: The "punk" aspect of Solarpunk is about rebellion against the status quo, promoting counterculture, post-capitalism, and decolonialism, and fostering a spirit of enthusiasm and proactive change​
8. **Vision of a Post-Scarcity World**: Solarpunk imagines a future that is post-scarcity, post-hierarchy, and post-capitalistic, where humanity sees itself as part of nature, and clean energy replaces fossil fuels​

These tenets collectively reflect Solarpunk's goal of creating a world that is ecologically sound, socially just, and technologically integrated, offering an optimistic and practical roadmap for a sustainable future.
